# Epitech-push_swap_bonus
A visual program to show how my push_swap works.

Made with CSFML.

To sort the list, I used binary Radix-sort

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8jx_Gt_bD4) showing how it works.

# Installation

You will need to clone the repository.

Make sure you have git and [CSFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) installed on your computer, and that it runs on linux.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quentin-Desmettre/epitech-push_swap
```

## Usage

```bash
cd epitech-push_swap

# build the program
make

# generate a list of 200 random numbers
python generator.py 200 > numbers

# launch the program
./push_swap numbers
```
